Transactions - Add Screen:

- Account can be a dropdown

Budget:

- "Add Category" button can be just an icon
- Could we add another grouping, like for example: "Transportation", which would include the categories: "Gas", "Auto Insurance", "Auto Maintenance", etc.
- Can we apply an icon/emoji to the name of the expenses?

Paycheck Planning:

- When allocating, it doesn't seem to apply to the income category, also in the expenses, it applies a red color, so it looks off or wrong like it's a bad thing that we allocated additional money to this? Does that make sense?

Subscriptions:

- Make a navigation button to handle subscriptions
